Hello!

Welcome to the Musicstore Catalog API and Musicstore Recommendation API.

These APIs are written in Java, are Springboot web applications, include J-Unit tests.

The musicstore-catalog REST API provides CRUD functionality for Label, Artist, Album, and Track entities.

The musicstore-recommendations REST API provides CRUD functionality for LabelRecommendation, ArtistRecommendation, AlbumRecommendation, and TrackRecommendation entities.

Both APIs are containerized and deployed to Heroku:

The musicstore-recommendations is deployed [here](https://vast-hamlet-71359.herokuapp.com/).

The musicstore-catalog is deployed [here](https://morning-spire-86152.herokuapp.com/).

You may clone the repository to test and exercise each API.

Enjoy!
